v More-dependent


-Core-
* Static libs only
* No code that causes unavoidable CRT initialization
* No dependencies outside of core
* Minimal inter-dependencies
* Clean utilitarian value to most applications

-Foundation-
* Always DLL-capable
* CRT initialization permitted
* No dependencies outside of core/foundation/platform
* Avoid inter-dependencies
* Conditional value to most applications

-Platform-
* Always DLL-capable
* CRT initialization permitted
* No dependencies outside of core/foundation/platform/OS-specific
* Avoid inter-dependencies
* Conditional value to most applications

-Game-
* Always DLL-capable
* CRT initialization permitted
* No dependencies on application modules
* Avoid inter-dependencies
* Conditional value to some games

-Application-
* Always DLL-capable
* CRT initialization permitted
* Dependencies as needed
* Only valuable to specific application

-Exectutable
* Minimal code, bootstrap only
* No dependencies outside of application/OS-specific
