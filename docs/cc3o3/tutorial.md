	* Has learned some strategy to optimize the basics
* Advanced
	* Understands all of the core mechanics
* Expert
	* Understands and can use more complex elements
* Master
	* Knows the ins and outs of the game, and how to make viable builds


### Basic
Loose concept tree:
* Stats
	* Physical defense
* Attack
	* Does damage
		* Higher level = more damage
	* Can miss
		* Higher level = less accurate
		* More attacks = more accurate
	* Takes stamina
		* Higher level = more stamina
		* Can't go negative
	* Builds guage
		* Higher level = more gauge
		* Can't go above max
* Defend
	* Raises physical defense
	* Raises elemental defense
	* Takes stamina
		* Can't go negative
	* Can't cancel once activated
		* Cancels when opponent's turn ends
* Element
	* Limited slots
		* Must plan before battle
	* Consumed on use
		* Restored after battle
		* Can NOT restore in battle
	* Takes guage
		* Higher level = more gauge
		* Can't go negative
	* Takes stamina
		* Always takes a ton
		* Can go negative
* Time
	* Actions take time
	* Stamina restores over time
		* Not enough to take infinite actions per turn
* Turn
	* Turn ends when entire party out of stamina
	* Turn ends when entire party is defending


### Intermediate
Loose concept tree:
* Stats
	* Can buff/debuff physical damage
	* Can buff/debuff physical defense
	* Can buff/debuff elemental damage
	* Can buff/debuff elemental defense
	* Can buff/debuff minimum accuracy
	* Buffs/debuffs are STRONG
* Attack
	* Bigger risks = bigger payoffs
* Element
	* Multiple colors
		* Pairs of opposites
		* Resistances/weaknesses based on innate color
		* Proficiencies/deficiencies based on innate color
	* Some elements have multiple uses (stack)
		* Are normally/always curative items
* Defend
	* Stamina restores faster when defending during opponent's turn
* Turn
	* Negative stamina during opponent's turn is risky


### Advanced
Loose concept tree:
* Attack
	* Requires buff/debuffs to compete with element damage
* Element
	* Some elements do physical damage
* Field
	* Changes color with elements used
		* First in, first out
		* Some elements (curative items) don't affect field
	* Influences proficiencies/deficiencies of all characters
		* Makes a big difference when heavily skewed
* Time counter
	* Meter builds over time
	* Can activate to end opponent's turn
* Turn
	* Turn ends when opponent time counters
		* Cannot counter time counter immediately after
			* Delay influenced by stamina of party vs opponent


### Expert
* Element
	* Locks
		* Prevent a type of element from being used
		* Expire after an moderate amount of time
		* Targeted locks affect a single enemy character
			* Can be removed by some curative items
		* Global locks affect all characters, enemy or otherwise
			* Cannot be removed
	* Traps
		* Have no immediate effect
		* Last indefinitely
		* Trigger when a specific type of element is used by enemy character
			* Causes the element to have no effect
		* Partially fills time counter meter when triggered
			* Can exceed natural maximum (Overcharge)
			* Cannot exceed Overcharge maximum
			* If already at Overcharge maximum, performs a free time counter
	* Chains
		* Changes to a different element after use
		* Is fully consumed at end of chain
		* Is fully consumed if another element is used (chain break)
	* Innate-restricted
		* Can only be used by a character with innate profeciency
	* Gimmicks
		* Non-standard rule-changing abilities
* Gear
	* Stat adjust
		* Affects multiple stats
		* Always trades equal losses for equal gains
	* Gimmicks
		* Non-standard rule-changing abilities


### Master
Loose concept tree:
* Element count distribution
	* Single-target damage: Plentiful
	* AOE damage: Plentiful
	* Buffs: Plentiful
	* Debuffs: Plentiful
	* Traps: Diverse, but low duplicates
	* Locks: Diverse, but low duplicates
	* Heals: Moderate, and limited to certain colors
	* Curative items: Infrequent, but stack
	* Gimmicks: Rare, often/always innate-restricted
	* Chains: Rare, often/always innate-restricted
	* Ressurects: Rare, and limited to certain colors
* Builds
	* A damage element oriented party provides good burst damage
		* Elements can go negative to pressure for a kill
		* Opponent has to avoid falling into kill range
	* A buff/debuff oriented party has a lot of staying power
		* Can get more mileage out of attacks
		* Can defend more often
		* Can use less elements per turn
	* A heal oriented party is non-viable
		* Limited element slots
		* Limited healing element counts acquired
		* Curative items don't affect field
		* Most parties will have decent healing capabilities already
		* Opponent can prepare their strategy uncontested and wait
	* A full field can be achieved and used in a single turn
		* Very obvious setup, telegraphs to opponent
		* Requires going negative on all characters
		* Opponent can time counter and punish hard
	* A lock oriented party can severely hamper inflexible opponents
		* Locks are difficult to remove before they naturally expire
		* A single lock can hard-counter a full field
		* A single lock can neuter a character reliant on a specific color
		* Opponent has to have a flexible party, or an attack oriented party
	* A trap oriented party can prevent opponent from playing or insta-kill
		* Time counters can be achieved faster than normal with good reads
		* Big overcharges can be stacked up with enough triggered traps
		* Multiple time counters available mean a party is rarely in danger
		* Multiple time counters in a row allow for a lockdown and kill
		* Opponent has to keep stamina high to reduce counter time counter delay
		* Opponent has to be unpredictable or predict traps
	* A chain oriented party can create a kill-or-be-killed setup
		* Chains are powerful and dangerous if allowed to complete
		* Opponent has to force party to break chain or mitigate its effects
	* A gimmick team can do various bizzarre things
		* Access to rule-changing logic
		* Opponent has to decipher strategy and react appropriately
	* A balanced team can match all builds
		* Can choose the best strategy on the fly
		* Resilient to soft/hard-counters
		* Has access to all soft/hard-counters
		* Limited in how long a strategy can be maintained
		* Requires more efficient use of resources
		* Opponent has to survive threatening strategies and punish ineffective ones
