LIBRARY PLATFORMUTILS_WIN32
EXPORTS
; Normally the project export/import API should be used instead, but there are
;  some cases where the implementation of another library are provided here, in
;  which case the export/import API doesn't apply. In those cases, the relevant
;  implementations will be specified here, so they can be linked to
; EXAMPLE: core_platform may declare that a function exists, but doesn't
;  provide an implementation since it is platform-specific, and each platform
;  is expected to implement it in their modules
